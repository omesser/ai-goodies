# Release Notes

## Purpose

Generate polished, human-readable release notes between two versions using full git history and optional external metadata sources.

Default behavior:

- Balanced tone (not too short, not too verbose)
- Include tracked (ticket/PR-linked) and untracked commits
- Never skip meaningful PR-linked changes just because Jira metadata is missing
- Output sections: Features, Bugfixes, Internal Improvements
- Prefix each bullet with short source links when available (Jira/PR)
- Return text unless file editing is explicitly requested
- Read full commit context (subject, body), not just one-line commit messages

## Inputs

- End version/tag (required, example: `11.29.0`)
- Start version/tag (optional, example: `11.28.2`)
  - If omitted, resolve previous version automatically from git refs.
- Optional external source credentials (only for enabled sources):
  - `ATLASSIAN_BASE_URL` (example: `https://company.atlassian.net`)
  - `EMAIL`
  - optional: `JIRA_TOKEN`
  - optional: `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  - stored in `.agents/skills/release-notes/release-notes-secrets.env`

## Workflow

1. Resolve refs for range

- Prefer explicit refs like `versions/web-app/<version>`.
- Verify end ref exists.
- If start version is not provided, infer it semantically:
  - Find refs/tags in the same release stream as the end ref (for example `versions/web-app/*`).
  - Parse semantic versions and pick the nearest lower version than the end version.
  - Use that as the start ref.
  - If no lower version exists, fail with a clear message asking for explicit start version.
- Verify inferred/provided start ref exists.

2. Read commit history with full context

- Use `scripts/collect_commit_context.py` to collect:
  - subject
  - full body
  - `jira_keys` extracted from each commit message
- Keep:
  - tracked commits (contain issue/PR identifiers)
  - untracked commits (no external identifier)

3. Enrich from external sources (optional, source-specific)

- Jira source is currently implemented:
  - `scripts/sources/fetch_jira_issues.py`
  - Input: commit JSON from `collect_commit_context.py`
  - Output: same commit list with `jira_issues` metadata per commit
  - If `JIRA_TOKEN` is missing, script returns input commits unchanged (with empty `jira_issues`)
  - If `JIRA_TOKEN` is set, requires `ATLASSIAN_BASE_URL` and `EMAIL`
  - Resolves `CLOUD_ID` from `ATLASSIAN_BASE_URL`
- GitHub PR source is implemented:
  - `scripts/sources/fetch_github_prs.py`
  - Input: commit JSON from `collect_commit_context.py` (or Jira-enriched JSON)
  - Output: same commit list with `github_pr` metadata per commit (`title`, `description`, etc.)
  - If `GITHUB_TOKEN` is missing, script returns input commits unchanged (with `github_pr=null`)
- Continue even when some source lookups fail; note missing metadata.

4. Categorize changes

- Source metadata indicates bug fix -> Bugfixes
- Source metadata indicates feature/story/epic -> Features (unless clearly internal-only)
- Tooling/refactor/infrastructure/convention work -> Internal improvements
- PR-linked commits without Jira:
  - still include if they have meaningful product or engineering impact
  - classify from PR title/description/branch context (do not drop due to missing Jira)
- Untracked commits:
  - `fix/*` or `bugfix/*` patterns usually Bugfixes
  - `feature/*` patterns usually Features unless tooling-only
  - formatting/conventions/test infra/refactors usually Internal improvements

5. Write notes in human language

- Do not just copy issue/PR titles.
- Use descriptions when available to capture intent and impact.
- Group related items into themes.
- Keep user-facing impact first, technical detail second.
- Add short drill-down links at the beginning of each bullet when available:
  - Prefer `[Jira: PZ-12345](...)` for Jira-tracked work
  - Prefer `[PR #1234](...)` for GitHub PR context
  - If both are available, include both, with Jira first
  - If Jira is unavailable but PR exists, include PR-only link and keep the item
  - Keep links compact and at the very start of the bullet so they are easy to remove

## Output Format

```markdown
# Release Notes <toVersion>

## Features

- [Jira: PZ-12345](https://.../browse/PZ-12345) [PR #1234](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/1234) Add support for ....
- [PR #1231](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/1231) Improve ....

## Fixed Bugs

- [Jira: PZ-12000](https://.../browse/PZ-12000) Fix ....

## Internal Improvements

- [PR #1204](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/1204) Refactor ....
```

## Quality Bar

- Keep claims grounded in commit and source evidence.
- Prefer full commit context over branch-name guesses.
- Mention uncertainty when classification is ambiguous.
- Keep secrets out of outputs (never print tokens).
- Prefer concise, outcome-focused wording.
- Keep link prefixes short and consistent for easy bulk removal.
- Ensure meaningful PR-only items are represented; missing Jira is not a reason to omit a change.

## Source Notes (Jira)

- Preferred `.agents/skills/release-notes/release-notes-secrets.env` shape:
  - `ATLASSIAN_BASE_URL=https://company.atlassian.net`
  - `EMAIL=...`
  - `JIRA_TOKEN=...` (optional; enables Jira enrichment)
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN=...` (optional; enables GitHub PR enrichment)
- Jira auth uses Basic auth with `EMAIL:JIRA_TOKEN`.
- `401` on Jira auth with `-u`:
  - token/account mismatch, expired token, or invalid token.
- `404` for specific issue:
  - missing key, wrong project key, or permission restriction.
- Bearer token failing on site endpoints:
  - use Cloud ID endpoint with Basic auth for this flow.

## References

- Workflow examples: [references/examples.md](references/examples.md)
- Scripts:
  - `scripts/collect_commit_context.py`
  - `scripts/sources/fetch_jira_issues.py`
  - `scripts/sources/fetch_github_prs.py`

## Auto-previous version lookup

When user provides only `toVersion`, infer `fromVersion` from the same stream:

- Normalize `toVersion` as `versions/web-app/<toVersion>` when that ref exists.
- Enumerate candidates from `git tag -l "versions/web-app/*"` (or matching ref namespace).
- Keep only semantic versions lower than `<toVersion>`.
- Select the closest lower version as `<fromVersion>`.
- Build range as `<fromRef>..<toRef>`.
